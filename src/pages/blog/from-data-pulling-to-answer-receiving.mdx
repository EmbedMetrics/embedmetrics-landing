# From Data Pulling to Answer Receiving: The Shift in BI Expectations and Reporting

The Rising Expectations of SaaS Teams

Reports and dashboards are cornerstones of analytics. They provide structure, accountability, and clarity for decision-making. QA teams, product managers, and executives all rely on them.

But expectations have grown. Alongside reports, users increasingly want to interact with their data directly. They want to be able to ask, "Which tests are flaky this sprint?" or "What's our automation coverage trend?" and get the answer immediately, without waiting for the next report.

## The Inclusive Future of Analytics

This isn't about replacing dashboards. It's about expanding the user experience.

**Reports and dashboards** give teams the full picture.

**Conversational analytics** makes that data more interactive by answering follow-up questions in real time.

Together, they create an inclusive approach where both technical and nontechnical users can work with data in a way that fits their needs.

## A Scenario from QA Teams

Consider a QA Lead preparing for a release. Reports provide detailed defect trends and coverage metrics. But in a standup, when someone asks about this sprint's flakiest tests, they don't want to pause and generate a new chart. They want a quick answer drawn from the same data that powers the reports.

Conversational BI makes this possible. It sits alongside dashboards, extending their value by turning data into a dialogue.

## Why This Matters for SaaS Decision Makers

For SaaS leaders, this shift is about adoption and accessibility. Dashboards continue to serve power users and analysts. Conversational BI lowers the barrier for everyone else, making insights available where people already work.

That means:

**Speed:** quick answers when decisions can't wait.

**Adoption:** broader usage across technical and nontechnical roles.

**ROI:** more value from the same underlying reports and data sources.
