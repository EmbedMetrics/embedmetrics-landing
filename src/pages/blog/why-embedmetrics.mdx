# Why EmbedMetrics

Dashboards were meant to help. But for most teams, they've become a wall instead of a window.

Whether you're a **[VP of Sales](./vp-sales-weekly-review-without-dashboards) reviewing weekly numbers**, a **product manager tracking adoption**, or a **founder trying to understand churn**, one thing is clear:

**You don't want dashboards. You want answers.**

## The Problem

Most dashboards are built for the person who created them, not the person looking at them.

They're:

- Hard to drill into
- Limited by pre-set filters
- Often require analyst help for follow-ups
- Frequently ignored unless something's on fire

Worse, they live in separate tools, forcing users to context-switch, remember filters, and interpret data on their own.

## The Idea

**EmbedMetrics** is a smart, embeddable data assistant that lives _inside_ your product.

It's:

- A **conversational analytics UI** that looks like chat
- Powered by AI to understand natural-language queries
- Embedded directly into internal dashboards or SaaS UIs
- Connected to your dataset, with safe, semantic understanding

Users just ask a question like:

- _"What changed since last week?"_
- _"Compare this quarter to last quarter"_
- _"What are our top products by revenue this month?"_

And they get **clear visual answers**: bar charts, KPIs, trend lines, tables, and smart follow-ups when they need more.

---

## Why Now

- **AI-native UX is going mainstream**: People expect interfaces they can talk to.
- **Dashboards are dying**: Adoption is low. Context-switching kills usage.
- **Embedded analytics is rising**: Users want answers where they already are.
- **Developer expectations have changed**: You don't want to iframe a dashboard, you want to drop in a component that _just works_.

---

## Who It's For

EmbedMetrics is built for:

- Developers who want a plug-and-play assistant, not another iframe
- SaaS product teams who want to embed analytics _without building dashboards_
- Sales and RevOps leaders who want to ask "What changed this week?" and get a real answer

You don't need to train your users. Just drop it in, and they ask. It answers.

---

## How It Works

EmbedMetrics connects a React-based chat UI to a backend powered by:

- A **semantic model** that knows your data
- An **AI intent engine** that parses natural queries into structured JSON
- A **query planner** that turns that intent into SQL
- A **visualization mapper** that generates charts, KPIs, and tables, with insight spotlights and follow-up suggestions to guide users

**It's how your users get to insight in seconds: no training, no dashboards, no delay.**

All wrapped in a lightweight, embeddable, brandable component. And yes, it runs on-prem too.
