# How a VP of Sales Runs Her Weekly Reviewâ€”Without Dashboards

## What if your weekly sales review didn't start with dashboards?

If you're leading a distributed sales team, you probably know the drill:

- Open the dashboards
- Filter by region
- Export the data
- Ping RevOps for the one view that's missing

It's a choreâ€”and it happens before you even start interpreting what's going on.

But what if you could skip all that?  
What if you could just ask your data, directly, inside your team's existing tools?

> "How did sales perform last week across regions?"  
> "Break that down by product line."  
> "Compare this quarter to Q1."  
> "What's our top-selling products in Europe this month?"

Let's walk through how that could work.

## Meet Lina, a VP of Sales at a Global SaaS Company

Lina leads a sales org spread across North America, Europe, and APAC. She starts each week by reviewing regional performance and highlighting outliers.

She's data-drivenâ€”but she's not a dashboard power user.  
What she wants is **context**. Fast. Without switching apps or asking analysts.

## A Smarter, Embedded Way to Review Data

Imagine Lina's team has embedded a smart data assistant inside their internal sales portal. Instead of navigating static dashboards, she opens the assistant and types her questions:

### 1. "How did sales perform last week across regions?"

â†’ Returns a bar chart showing revenue by NA, EU, and APAC.

### 2. "Break that down by product line."

â†’ The assistant updates the chart with product-level detail per region.

### 3. "Compare this quarter to Q1."

â†’ Lina sees a grouped bar chart: side-by-side regional revenue for two quarters.

### 4. "What's our top-selling products in EU this month?"

â†’ She gets a ranked list by units sold, no clicks required.

### 5. "Show me weekly revenue trend for NA."

â†’ A smooth time-series chart, grouped by week.

## This Isn't BI. It's Conversation.
