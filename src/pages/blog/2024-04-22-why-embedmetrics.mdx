# Why Iâ€™m Building EmbedMetrics (and Whatâ€™s Coming Next)

For years, Iâ€™ve seen how painful embedded analytics can be â€” for both developers and end users. Whether itâ€™s **clunky dashboards bolted onto apps** or **overly complex BI platforms with steep learning curves**, the current options just donâ€™t deliver what modern products need: **insights that feel native, fast, and simple**.

**EmbedMetrics is my answer to that gap.**

After leading engineering teams in the business intelligence space, I realized how many companies are stuck in the same pattern â€” struggling to embed dashboards, building custom reporting layers, or retrofitting AI into aging tools.

And hereâ€™s the deeper issue:  
Even when dashboards are embedded, theyâ€™re usually **static**. They can only answer the questions someone thought to pre-program. The moment a user wants to dig deeper or explore a slightly different angle, they hit a wall.

With **EmbedMetrics**, Iâ€™m taking a different approach:

- **Embed-first by design** â€” built from the ground up to drop into any web app with minimal effort.
- **Conversational interface** â€” users ask questions in natural language and get meaningful answers, not just charts.
- **AI-native experience** â€” AI isnâ€™t bolted on, itâ€™s central. It powers everything from query interpretation to insight generation.  
  _And while AI drives the experience, your data stays fully in your control._
- **Dev-friendly stack** â€” React + Spring Boot, containerized, and ready to integrate cleanly.

Weâ€™re currently focused on building out the MVP â€” nailing the core loop:  
ðŸ‘‰ user asks a question â†’ the system interprets it â†’ returns a clean, embeddable answer (visual, KPI, table, etc.).

But weâ€™re just scratching the surface.  
This isnâ€™t about returning one chart â€” itâ€™s about enabling a flow: follow-up questions, guided insights, and smart suggestions. Ultimately, weâ€™re building an AI-native experience where the system doesnâ€™t just answer â€” it helps users figure out what to ask next.

## Whatâ€™s next?

- Finishing the MVP
- Opening early access
- Connecting with product teams who want to go beyond dashboards

If that sounds interesting, follow along â€” or reach out if youâ€™re building something that could use a smarter, more flexible way to deliver insights.

Weâ€™re just getting started.  
**The goal is simple: make embedded analytics actually usable.**
